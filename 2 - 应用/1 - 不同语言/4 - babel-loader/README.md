Babel-loader ([source](https://github.com/ruanyf/webpack-demos/tree/master/demo03))

Loaders are preprocessors which transform a resource file of your app ([more info](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/)) before Webpack's building process.

For example, [Babel-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-loader) can transform JSX/ES6 file into normal JS filesï¼Œafter which Webpack will begin to build these JS files. Webpack's official doc has a complete list of [loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/).

`main.jsx` is a JSX file.

```javascript
// main.jsx
const React = require("react");
const ReactDOM = require("react-dom");

ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello, world!</h1>, document.querySelector("#wrapper"));
```

index.html

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="wrapper"></div>
    <script src="bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

webpack.config.js

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: "./main.jsx",
  output: {
    filename: "bundle.js",
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader",
          options: {
            presets: ["es2015", "react"],
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

The above snippet uses `babel-loader` which needs Babel's preset plugins [babel-preset-es2015](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-es2015) and [babel-preset-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-react) to transpile ES6 and React.
